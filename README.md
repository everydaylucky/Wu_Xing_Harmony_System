# Five-Element (Wu Xing) Harmony System 

Five-Element Facial Expression Recognition
---
Running `video.py` will automatically open the camera to detect facial expressions and upload them to the server for processing and recognition.


Five-Element Music Style Transfer
---
Replace the `input.wav` file in the folder with the music you want to transform, and rename the file to `input.wav`. The system will then use the results of your facial expression recognition to transform the uploaded music into a corresponding Five Elements music style. Please ensure that the uploaded music is within 20 seconds in length.
